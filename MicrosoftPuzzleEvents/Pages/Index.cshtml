            <p>Microsoft has a rich tradition of puzzling powered by volunteer groups from around the company. We’re proud to present two puzzle events this summer that have been adapted to run purely virtually, built specifically for our summer interns. Whether you’ve never looked at puzzles before, are a veteran puzzle solver, or anywhere in between, grab some teammates and we’re confident you’ll find an experience that you’ll love.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <p><em>Microsoft Intern Puzzleday</em> is inspired by and is built to be a less intense version of the Microsoft Puzzlehunt and MIT IAP Mystery Hunt in which teams of interns work together or split up to solve a large number of original puzzles of different kinds as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>The <em>Microsoft Intern Game</em> is traditionally a road rally event inspired by The Game and Midnight Madness in which teams of interns work together to overcome a series of team-based challenges focused on communications and working together.</p>
        <p>In adapting these events from in-person to online, we've noticed that they may feel a bit similar at first glance, and we’d like to help you understand the difference and to find which are right for you. You can participate in either or both!</p>

        <p>You’re welcome and encouraged to participate in either or both of these events – if you’re not sure, we recommend giving Intern Puzzleday a try; it’s built to be accessible and fun for everyone and we’ve scheduled these events intentionally so that you can give Puzzleday a try before deciding whether to commit to Intern Game.</p>
        <p> For interns with special needs, please contact the organizers as early as possible so appropriate accommodations can be made.</p>
